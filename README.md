# Sequencer-Snare

For the final project of the second year of higher grade, we have decided to make a synthesizer based on the one that [Erica Synths](https://www.ericasynths.lv/about/) created. The work of this project has been divided into two groups. This GitHub repository is for the Sequencer and Snare Drum modules. If you want to see the Kick and Hi Hat modules made by the other group, you can access their repository [here](https://github.com).
